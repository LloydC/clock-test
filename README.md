# Tech assignment: Clock

This assignment is for gauging your knowledge of Javascript.
You should take no more than 2 hours to complete it.
In case you are done early: look at ways to refactor your code.
In case you're not finished: that's also OK.

We care for quality over quantity.
*Building the right code is more important than building all code*.

## The Goal

Implement a clock that handles times without dates.

You should be able to add minutes to and subtract minutes from it.

Two clocks that represent the same time should be equal to each other.

## Setup

- Install NodeJS: follow instructions on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Making the test suite pass

- Execute the tests with:

```bash
npm test
```

In the test suite all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xtest` to
`test`.

Use git for this assignment the way how you would use for any other project you care about.

## Submitting the assignment

Once you run out of time, have the assignment ready or just feel like it, you can submit it using:

```bash
git push --all
```

## Submitting Incomplete Assignments

It's possible to submit an incomplete assignment. Push your code as often as you want!
